A blackjack simulation program to determine the win, lose and tie probability of n games.

# Rules of Blackjack
Blackjack is a game which a player plays against a dealer. Both the player and the dealer try to get cards that add up to as high a number as possible without crossing 21. Crossing 21 means you automatically lose. If both the player and the dealer both cross 21, the dealer wins. However, the player can see one of the dealer’s cards before making their decision, whereas the dealer acts independently of the player’s cards, generally continuing until its score hits 17.
Each numerical card (2–10) is worth its number, an ace is worth 1 or 11, a face card is worth 10. Note that this means there are effectively 4 times as many 10s (10, J, Q,K) as other cards. There are various other caveats, like blackjack bonuses, splits, and doubles.

But in this project, we will be ignoring blackjack bonuses, splits and doubles.
